# WHY ASR Copilot

**The problem:** Program managers routinely spend close to a workday each week aggregating spreadsheets, chasing risk updates, and crafting executive-ready status packs across siloed tools.

**What changes with ASR Copilot (No-Integration Mode):**

- Status prep: **8–12 hours → ~10–15 minutes** once CSV/Markdown files are normalized and deterministic earned value metrics are calculated.
- Risk surfacing: **Ad-hoc → continuous**, with a Top 5 watchlist and mitigation prompts that keep owners honest.
- Exec pack creation: **Manual → 1-click** Markdown + charts saved locally, ready for email or decks.

**Agentic fit:**

- *Assist* – deterministic analytics and templated narrative generation that keep humans in the loop.
- *Orchestrate* – adapters coordinate read-only Jira/Slack/ServiceNow calls in Safe Mode by default.
- *Autopilot* – explicit opt-in for scheduled runs with guardrails and audit trails when live credentials are provided.

**Rationalization lens:** For a 10-PMO program investing ~10 hours per PM each week on status operations, a 70–80% cycle-time cut frees **7–8 PM-days every week**. That translates into covering more programs with the same headcount or redeploying talent to higher-value delivery work.
