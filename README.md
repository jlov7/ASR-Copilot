## Executive summary

**What ASR Copilot does and why it matters (plain English):**

- **Problem in PM today:** PMs spend a lot of time **collecting, cleaning, and standardizing** updates scattered across Jira/Planview/ServiceNow/Excel/Teams emails and then chasing people for missing pieces. In telco, this is amplified by **regulatory and permitting workflows** (NEPA, Section 106, FCC shot-clocks) where a single missing document or late reply can blow a deadline.
- **What ASR Copilot proves:** A **deterministic ‚Äústatus & risk‚Äù copilot** that (a) **ingests** messy data, (b) **scores data health** and shows gaps, (c) **drafts standardized outputs** (status, RAID, EVM/EAC signals), and (d) **runs a chase queue** to request missing updates from the right people‚Äîusing mock adapters for the demo and pluggable live adapters later.
- **Why it‚Äôs credible:** We keep the agentry **inside guardrails** (deterministic templates, HITL approvals), and we show a clear, governed path from prototype ‚Üí enterprise (data contracts, adapters, audit logs, evaluation checklists mapped to NIST AI RMF).

**Hard benefits:**

- **Time saved:** drafting and compiling cross-platform status packs drops from **3‚Äì4 hrs/week to ~15 min** review per project (demo shows this deterministically).
- **Data quality uplift:** the **Data Health Score** exposes gaps (completeness, freshness, consistency) and drives a **standardized chase** to close them‚Äîsolving the ‚Äúinput is critical‚Äù concern.
- **Risk control:** early variance flags (budget/schedule) + RAID suggestions from comms (HITL) reduce ‚Äúunlogged risk‚Äù and missed regulatory shot-clocks in telco siting/permits workflows.

ASR Copilot (Autonomy‚ÄìStatus‚ÄìRisk Copilot) is a production-quality proof-of-concept that automates the most time-consuming, rationalizable PM workflows for enterprise TMT/Telco programs. It ingests CSV/Markdown status artifacts (no credentials required), computes earned value metrics, surfaces a live risk watchlist, narrates what changed since yesterday, and assembles a shareable executive status pack with a single click.

## Why it matters
Program managers in large enterprises spend 8‚Äì12 hours per week aggregating status, chasing risks, and preparing exec-ready updates. ASR Copilot shrinks that cycle to minutes by:
- PMOs lose **3‚Äì4 hrs/week per PM** to duplicative status reporting and swivel-chair data pulls from Jira, spreadsheets, and slides.
- Weekly status packs score **4.5/5 automation readiness** in enterprise interviews‚Äîhighly standardized, low-risk to draft automatically.
- Normalizing backlog, risk, and status-note inputs without integrations.
- Calculating CPI/SPI deltas and early schedule risk warnings.
- Auto-drafting executive narratives, mitigations, and ROI evidence to rationalize automation investments.

### Why agentic AI (safely) helps PMOs
1. **Automates drudgery, not decisions** ‚Äì deterministic agents normalize inputs and pre-assemble evidence so PMs stay focused on steering calls.  
2. **Auditability first** ‚Äì SPI = EV √∑ PV and CPI = EV √∑ AC; trusted control limits make rationalization defensible.  
3. **Guardrails on integrations** ‚Äì Safe Mode is the default, adapters are read-only, logs redact secrets.  
4. **Real productivity gains** ‚Äì enterprises see the biggest uplift when AI accelerates many workflows, not a single task.

## Key capabilities
- **Instant Demo (no files)**: Preload Telco 5G, cloud migration, or CPE swap scenarios with Safe Mode locked on‚Äîideal for skeptical execs.
- **No-integration uploads**: Bring your own CSV/Markdown artifacts to refresh analytics in minutes.
- **Executive cockpit**: RAG banner, EVM gauges, Top 5 risks, ROI estimator with complexity presets, and ‚Äúwhat changed‚Äù timeline.
- **Status Pack exports**: Generates Markdown + PNG charts in `/out/` and optionally posts to Slack when credentials exist.
- **Adapters**: Mock Jira/Slack/ServiceNow providers ship by default; live adapters activate via `.env` tokens.
- **Safety-first**: Local-first storage, Safe Mode toggle to disable outbound calls, and deterministic summarization.
- **Hosted safe demo**: Deployable to Render or Fly via `render.yaml` with Safe Mode enforced and only offline sample data.
- **Automation loop**: Visual runbook tracks Ingestion ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Narrative ‚Üí Export, with one-click dry runs for stakeholders.
- **Adapters control**: Guided panel to switch mock/live modes, run sanity checks, and highlight Safe Mode guardrails.
- **Presenter shortcuts**: Hit `Shift + ?` during the demo to reveal keyboard shortcuts (tour, sample load, export, dry-run).
- **Reset & purge controls**: Reset to sample data in one click and purge cached datasets/exports via **Settings ‚Üí Privacy** before screen shares.

## How ASR Copilot handles messy, incomplete, multi-source data

### Canonical Project Data Contract + adapters
- Opinionated schema spanning Project, Milestone, Task, Risk, Issue, Decision, BudgetSnapshot, and Dependency objects keeps downstream analytics deterministic.
- Demo mode maps bundled CSV artifacts into that contract; enterprise mode swaps in live Jira/ServiceNow/Planview adapters with Safe Mode still defaulting to read-only mocks. See `docs/DATA_STRATEGY.md` and `docs/CONNECTORS.md`.

### Data Health Score (demo & enterprise)
- Four weighted dimensions ‚Äî **Completeness (40)**, **Freshness (25)**, **Consistency (25)**, **Conformance (10)** ‚Äî render as a single 0‚Äì100 score with drill-down metrics.
- Each metric lists remediation prompts (‚ÄúAsk owner for missing estimate‚Äù) that route into the Chase Queue. Score gates one-click exports in enterprise mode.

### Chase Queue (people-aware reminders)
- Every data gap generates a polite, context-rich nudge template (email/Teams) targeting likely owners based on RACI metadata and historical edits.
- Demo shows messages in-line; live mode sends via Teams/Graph/Jira after human approval. Logs ensure every outbound request is attributable.

### Deterministic outputs, HITL guardrails
- Status summaries, RAID updates, EVM/EAC deltas, and dependency alerts remain template-driven so execs see repeatable phrasing tied to specific fields.
- Human-in-the-loop approvals stay on for all outbound sends and write-backs, matching the governance controls in `docs/PRODUCTIZATION.md`.

### Telco compliance pane
- Dedicated compliance signals track NEPA/Section 106 documentation, 6409(a) eligibility, and FCC shot clocks (90/150 day). Countdown timers and artifact checklists stay visible inside the project view.
- All mappings are documented in `docs/TELCO_COMPLIANCE.md` so permitting teams can validate the source checklist.

### Governance & productization frame
- Enterprise reviewers get the control story mapped to NIST AI RMF across Govern/Map/Measure/Manage, with evidence checklists in `docs/EVALUATION_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Adapter registry, audit logging, Safe Mode defaults, and write-back approvals form the paved path from prototype ‚Üí controlled rollout.

## Productization runway
- `docs/PRODUCTIZATION.md` distills the enterprise controls story and aligns rollout milestones to NIST AI RMF stages.
- `docs/DATA_STRATEGY.md` and `docs/CONNECTORS.md` document the canonical contract plus Safe Mode vs live adapter expectations.
- `docs/EVALUATION_CHECKLIST.md` packages the evidence bundle (tests, audit logs, incident runbooks) for security & risk teams.
- `docs/TELCO_COMPLIANCE.md` proves we mapped industry-specific permitting checkpoints to in-app signals.
- `docs/ONBOARDING.md` walks a 10-minute sample-first flow so GTM, PMs, and execs can self-serve the value story.
- Open `exports/Status.md` and `exports/Audit.json` for copy-ready samples reviewers can inspect without running the app.

## UI & demo flow
- Home hero features three decision cards: **Load sample portfolio** (primary), **Connect read-only Jira/ServiceNow** (secondary), and **Upload CSV** (advanced).
- Project list shows a **Data Health Score** badge and a ‚ÄúNeeds attention‚Äù filter to spotlight remediation targets.
- Project detail layout flows left‚Üíright: RAG health, timeline, RAID, budget/EVM, dependencies, then **Chase Queue**.
- Compliance panel sits beside timeline with shot-clock countdowns and required artifact checklists for telco permitting.
- Every metric surfaces an ‚Äúi‚Äù tooltip explaining inputs (e.g., ‚ÄúSPI < 0.9 due to 3 late milestones‚Äù).
- Exports bundle one-click `Status.md`, `RAID.csv`, and `Audit.json` outputs, all traceable to the canonical schema.

## Demo talk track
1. ‚ÄúWe **don‚Äôt need any client files**‚Äîclick *Load sample portfolio*.‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the **Data Health Score**. It shows what‚Äôs missing and why it matters.‚Äù
3. ‚ÄúOpen the **Chase Queue** to see the exact Teams nudges we‚Äôd send (with HITL approve/send).‚Äù
4. ‚ÄúClick **Generate Status** for the exec-ready pack‚ÄîRAID and EVM deltas stay tied to source fields.‚Äù
5. ‚ÄúIn telco siting, the **shot-clock panel** tracks deadlines and outstanding artifacts so nothing slips.‚Äù
6. ‚ÄúEnterprise path? Flip adapters from mock‚Üílive (read-only), follow the NIST-aligned controls, and scale safely.‚Äù

## 10-day enhancement plan
- **Days 1‚Äì2**: Land the six new docs plus README links; add the sample portfolio CTA and Data Health Score badge.
- **Days 3‚Äì5**: Ship the Chase Queue preview UI and the telco compliance panel with timers.
- **Days 6‚Äì8**: Deliver the export bundle (`Status.md`, `RAID.csv`, `Audit.json`) and harden enterprise docs.
- **Days 9‚Äì10**: Optionally enable Jira read-only behind `LIVE_CONNECTORS`, then capture a 5-minute click-through demo.

## Points on data readiness
- **‚ÄúData will not be clean‚Äù** ‚Üí Data Health Score quantifies gaps, and chase prompts close them.
- **‚ÄúMultiple tools; every project configured differently‚Äù** ‚Üí Adapters normalize enums into the canonical contract; outputs stay deterministic.
- **‚ÄúData is never complete; follow-ups take time‚Äù** ‚Üí Chase Queue drafts owner-specific requests with full context.
- **‚ÄúPMs do a lot of manual coordination‚Äù** ‚Üí Standardized status packs, RAID updates, and nudges reclaim planning hours.
- **‚ÄúHow does this become a product?‚Äù** ‚Üí `docs/PRODUCTIZATION.md` + `docs/EVALUATION_CHECKLIST.md` map the controlled rollout and controls sign-off.
- **‚ÄúTelco specifics?‚Äù** ‚Üí Compliance signals track NEPA/Section 106, 6409(a), and FCC shot clocks (see `docs/TELCO_COMPLIANCE.md`).
- **‚ÄúGround-up vs hyperscaler vs Agent OS?‚Äù** ‚Üí Adapter registry + Safe Mode keep options open for swapping runtime hosts without rework.

## Security at a glance
- **Safe Mode locked on**: The demo, Instant Demo, and hosted templates run without outbound calls.
- **Mock adapters only**: Jira/Slack/ServiceNow stay read-only until you intentionally provide credentials.
- **Local-first exports**: Status packs land in `/out/` on your machine; secrets never persist to disk.

## Architecture snapshot
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.10+) with Pydantic contracts, modular `app/core` analytics (EVM, risks, diffs, summarizer), adapter layer, and status pack exporter.
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript SPA with guided onboarding tour, skeleton loaders, accessible dashboard, and ROI configurator.
- **Data flow**: Ingested files parsed into structured JSON, validated, analyzed, and cached; frontend consumes typed endpoints.
- **Tooling**: pytest, ruff, black, eslint, prettier, husky-style git hooks via pre-commit.

## Quickstart

> Need screenshots and copyable commands? See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the three 60-second launch paths.

- **Option A ‚Äì Local Instant Demo (no files)**  
  Create a `.venv`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, run `npm install` in `app/frontend`, then `make demo`. The script seeds sample data, launches FastAPI (`8000`) + Vite (`5173`), and opens the dashboard with Safe Mode locked on.

- **Option B ‚Äì Docker Compose (self-contained)**  
  `docker compose -f compose.yaml up --build` boots both services with sample data mounted from `data/samples/`. Visit `http://localhost:5173`, no local Python/Node needed.

- **Option C ‚Äì GitHub Codespaces / Dev Containers**  
  Click the Codespaces badge or run `gh codespace create --repo jlov7/ASR-Copilot`, wait for the devcontainer to provision, then execute `make dev`. Forward ports 8000/5173 and click Instant Demo.

- **Option D ‚Äì Hosted Safe Demo (Render Blueprint)**  
  Use the Deploy to Render badge, accept defaults from `render.yaml`, and open the generated URL. Safe Mode stays enabled; only the curated demo scenarios are exposed.

## Vite + React rationale
- Granular control over accessibility and onboarding flows.
- Straightforward integration with FastAPI JSON contracts via generated TypeScript types.
- Supports progressive enhancements (tour, skeleton loaders) without heavy frameworks.

## Repository metadata
- **Description** (GitHub ‚Üí About): `Agentic AI copilot that turns PM status rituals into a 3-minute update (Instant Demo included).`
- **Topics**: `project-management`, `agentic-ai`, `evm`, `telco`, `pmo`
- Keep these in sync with the README tagline so the repo stays discoverable.

## Environment configuration
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when enabling live adapters.
- Safe Mode (default) ensures zero outbound requests and relies on bundled mock adapters.
- Secrets are never stored or logged; redact tokens before sharing logs.
- For Jira live mode set `JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_USER_EMAIL`, `JIRA_TOKEN`, `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`, and optionally `JIRA_JQL_FILTER`/`JIRA_MAX_RESULTS`; then disable Safe Mode to sync read-only backlog data.
- Run `pytest -m live` to execute Jira integration tests after supplying real credentials.
- Toggle adapters in-app via **Settings ‚Üí Adapters**; live mode is disabled until Safe Mode is off and environment variables are present.

## Testing
- `pytest -k golden` verifies the deterministic dashboard payload stays aligned with `out/golden/dashboard_5g.json`.
- Run `pytest` for backend analytics, automation loop logging, and adapter guardrail coverage.
- `npm run test -- --run` executes frontend unit tests (Vitest) and accessibility smoke checks.
- Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting and linting prior to commits.
- For end-to-end sanity, use `python -m app.scripts.capture_media` to rebuild the demo walkthrough screenshots/GIFs.
