# Evaluation & Controls (for platform, security, and risk reviewers)

## Security & Enterprise Fit
- SSO, least-privilege connectors, audit logs for every outbound call.

## Governance (NIST AI RMF)
- Govern/Map/Measure/Manage controls with evidence pointers:
  - Test results (adapter parity, EVM math).
  - Golden-file comparisons for status outputs.
  - Incident runbook (connector timeouts, malformed data, bad credentials).

## Extensibility
- Adapter registry, contract versioning, and deprecation policy.

## UX & Adoption
- “No files needed” path; “Why am I seeing this?” tooltips; inline evidence links.
